	<h1>About Local Image Viewer</h1>
	For local image viewer to work you have to allow it to access local file URLs at <a target="_blank" href="chrome://extensions/?id=lhlckkgdiojkapplglfeomlkjllphilo">chrome://extensions/</a>
	<br/><img src="img/help_fileurls.png" width="600" /><br/><br/>
	
	When Local Image Viewer is enabled, drag an image from a folder full of images into Chrome.
	<br/><img src="img/help_dragin.png" /><br/><br/>
	You may also set Google Chrome as the default handler for image file types.
	<br/><br/>
	Next and previous arrows will show up allowing you to switch to the next and previous images in the local directory.
	<br/><br/>
	This allows Google Chrome to operate as a functional replacement for the slow and buggy Windows Photo Viewer
	<br/><br/>
<!--	Windows Photo Viewer uses dllhost.exe to install a global hook in both dwmapi.dll AND MSCTF.dll each time it is run.
	<br/><br/>
	Also Windows Photo Viewer has a chance to crash the computer completely requiring system restart.
	<br/><br/>-->
	Now you can use Google Chrome to browse through directories of photos!

	Now it works more like Chrome OS.  Rate or share <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/local-image-viewer/lhlckkgdiojkapplglfeomlkjllphilo">Local Image Viewer</a>
